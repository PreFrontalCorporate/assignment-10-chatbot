1) Paste the three texts (persona_primary, guardrails, interviews) into the left panels.
2) Start a new thread with: “You are my target customer. What matters most when buying a phone case?”
3) Run the Validation Prompts (below) one by one. Capture surprising points in the Iteration Log.
4) Attach a sample product image and ask what would make it a “must buy.”
5) Iterate persona/guardrails when answers feel off; log each change. Export the JSON when done.

Validation prompts
- As Aisha, list top 3 purchase criteria for a MagSafe case and why. Cite interviews.
- What would make you abandon a cart at checkout? ≤5 bullets.
- Compare: $19 recycled case (5‑day ship) vs $24 TPU case (2‑day). Which and why?
- What unclear info on a product page slows you down or makes you suspicious?
- If we bundle case + cable + charger, which combo/price makes sense?

Evidence check prompts
- Identify 3 claims that need stronger evidence. Suggest how to validate.
- Which interview insights contradict each other? Propose a quick test to resolve.
- What did I forget to ask that would change your recommendation?

Quality gate (before exporting)
- Ask the bot: “Give me one risky assumption we should test next week.”
