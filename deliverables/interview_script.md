Interview Script (semi‑structured) — Phone Accessories
======================================================
Purpose: Understand purchase triggers, decision criteria, and objections.

Warm‑up
- Tell me about your current phone and accessories. What do you like/not like?

Shopping Journey
- Last time you bought a case/cable/charger, what happened from start to finish?
- Where did you look first? What convinced you to click “Buy” or leave?

Decision Criteria
- What makes you think an accessory is durable or safe?
- How do shipping cost/time and returns affect your decision?

Budget & Trade‑offs
- If Option A is cheaper but slower to ship than Option B, where’s the tipping point?
- What bundle would you actually buy today? What would you exclude?

Sustainability & Trust
- Do eco materials matter to you? How much would you pay extra?
- What signals make you trust a store? What looks sketchy?

Wrap‑up
- If we could fix one thing about buying accessories, what would it be?
- Anything else I didn’t ask that would change your recommendation?

Notes:
- Ask follow‑ups like “Can you tell me more?” “Why?” “What happened next?”
- Avoid leading questions; keep it conversational.
